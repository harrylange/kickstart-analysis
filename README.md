# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## **Overview of Project**

### **Purpose**

The purpose of this analysis is to illustrate to Louise how other campaigns fared based on their launch dates and funding goals.  She can use this data to forecast how the rest of her fundraising campaign will go.  

## **Analysis and Challenges**

### ** Analysis, Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**

For this activity, I had to use my knowledge of from the lectures to create a Pivot Table and a chart based on that Pivot Table.  I used a new-to-me function, YEAR() to create a new column in the Kickstarter sheet.  I didn't know how to this function, so I found some information for it [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/year-function-c64f017a-1354-490d-981f-578e8ec8d3b9).  I also needed to know how to name the Chart, once I created it, so I found that [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-or-remove-titles-in-a-chart-4cf3c009-1482-4908-922a-997c32ea8250).

I had never used the COUNTIFS() function before this activity, so I read [this documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/countifs-function-dda3dc6e-f74e-4aee-88bc-aa8c2a866842) before diving into creating this new sheet.  There was also a very helpful video tutorial about this function on the Bootcamp Spot challenge module.  I also struggled a little to create the line chart based on this sheet, so I found some helpful info [here](https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/line-chart.html).

## **Results**

- **What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**

    - Using the data of outcomes based on launch date, it seems as if late spring/early summer is the most successful time to start a fundraiser.  May, June, and July had the most successful campaigns.  These three months also had the majority of failed campaigns in the data set, but the difference between the successful campaigns and failed campaigns in these three months is far larger than the rest of year.  According to this data, May, June, and July are definitely the best months to start a Theater campaign.

    - The months of October and December are the times that will least likely produce a successful campaign.  Not only do these months have lower numbers of successful campaigns to begin with, but the ratio of successful campaigns to failed campaigns is much closer in these months.  I would not start a Theater campaign in either of these two months.  

- **What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
    - For the most part, it is easier to have a successful campaign if you are asking for less money to begin with.  More lower money campaigns are successful.  

- **What are some limitations of this dataset?**
    - The data is somewhat skewed because there are a lot more campaigns who's goal is less money than there are campaigns asking for higher money.  Because the data set of the higher money campaigns is less, the percentages get pushed one way or the other a lot faster.  

- **What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
    - A table and chart could be created to showcase the number of backers based on what country the campaign is in to show where the most people support theater campaigns.  
    - A table and chart could be created based on the number of backers and the amount of money pledged by country to showcase how much money the average backer is using to support theater in different parts of the world.
